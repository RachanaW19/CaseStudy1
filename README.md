In this case study I have used following clauses:
SELECT cluase = For selecting columns from tables and aliasing them.
FROM clause = Specifies the tables involved in the query.
INNER JOIN = Joins Employee and Department tables.
WHERE clause = Gives result based on condition specified with it.
ORDER BY clause = Orders the result according to the Department_id.
